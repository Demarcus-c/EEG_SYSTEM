# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection-in-EEG-Signals-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques
This project focuses on the analysis of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to study brain activity patterns and derive meaningful insights for research, medical, or BCI (Brainâ€“Computer Interface) applications. EEG measures electrical activity of the brain using multiple electrodes placed on the scalp, producing multi-channel time-series data.
